# ABC random forests for model choice and parameters estimation

Methodologies based on :
- [@pudlo2015reliable]
- [@raynal2016abc]

Libraries we use :
- [Ranger : A Fast Implementation of Random Forests](https://github.com/imbs-hl/ranger) [@wright2015ranger], there tuned to make "online" calculations (not storing the whole forests in memory)
- [Eigen : C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
